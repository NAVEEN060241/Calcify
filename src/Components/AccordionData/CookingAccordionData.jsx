      header: "üîç How Cooking Calculator Handles Unit Conversions",
      body: `The cooking calculator simplifies the process of converting units for ingredients, ensuring you can easily scale recipes without any hassle. Here's how it works:
      <ul class="m-4">
        <li class="mb-4">The calculator first determines the unit categories you're working with, <span className="text-info">such as volume (Cups, Milliliters, Tablespoons) or weight (Grams, Kilograms, Ounces).</span> For example, if your recipe requires 2 cups of flour, but you only have a scale that measures in grams, the calculator converts the 2 cups into grams for you.</li>
        <li class="mb-4">It then applies the relevant conversion factor based on the unit pair. Let's say you want to convert from cups to milliliters. The conversion factor for <span className="text-info">1 cup to milliliters is 240.</span> So, the calculator multiplies the number of cups by 240 to get the result. <br />
          <div class="mt-3"><code>Converted Quantity = Original Quantity √ó Conversion Factor</code></div>
        </li>
        <li class="mb-4">If you're working with weight units, <span className="text-info">like grams to ounces,</span>  the conversion factor would be 0.0353 for grams to ounces.The formula is similar: <br />
          <div class="mt-3"><code>Converted Weight = Original Weight √ó Conversion Factor</code></div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      With this approach, the calculator ensures accuracy and convenience, allowing you to scale recipes and switch between different measurement systems effortlessly!`,

      body: `Cooking temperatures have a huge impact on the texture, flavor, and nutritional content of your food. For example:
      <ul class="m-4">
        <li><span className="text-info">At low temperatures (around 90-150¬∞C),</span> slow cooking allows the breakdown of collagen in meat, making it tender.</li>
        <li><span className="text-info">At medium temperatures (around 150-200¬∞C),</span> roasting or grilling enhances flavor through caramelization and Maillard reactions.</li>
        <li><span className="text-info">High temperatures (above 200¬∞C)</span> produce searing or frying effects, creating a crispy texture and locking in juices.</li>
      </ul>
      By controlling temperature, you can master various cooking techniques for the best results.`,

      <ul class="m-4">
        <li><span className="text-info">Sweet & Savory:</span> Think bacon with maple syrup.</li>
        <li><span className="text-info">Spicy & Sweet:</span> Try chili with chocolate.</li>
        <li><span className="text-info">Sour & Salty:</span> Consider lime with salted fish.</li>

        <li><span className="text-info">Vegetables:</span> Steamed or boiled for 5-10 minutes.</li>
        <li><span className="text-info">Meats:</span> Roasted for 20-45 minutes depending on thickness.</li>
        <li><span className="text-info">Fish:</span> Typically takes 10-15 minutes depending on size and thickness.</li>
