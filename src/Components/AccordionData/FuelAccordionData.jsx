      body: `The fuel cost calculator uses a simple yet powerful formula to estimate how much you'll spend on fuel for a trip. Here's how it works behind the scenes:
      <ol class="m-4">
        <li class="mb-4"><p>First, it calculates the fuel efficiency of your vehicle using: </p>
          <code>Fuel Efficiency = Distance Driven √∑ Fuel Consumed</code>
        </li>
        <li><p>Next, it multiplies the total distance of your trip by the fuel price, and then divides by the fuel efficiency:</p> 
          <code>Fuel Cost = Distance √∑ Fuel Efficiency √ó Fuel Price</code>
        </li>
      </ol>
      With this formula, the calculator accurately predicts the total cost of fuel for any journey, helping you plan better and save money.`,
