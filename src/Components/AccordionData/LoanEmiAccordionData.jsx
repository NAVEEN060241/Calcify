        <li><span className="text-info">Simplifies budgeting:</span> Knowing your monthly outflow helps plan other expenses.</li>
        <li><span className="text-info">Fixed tenure:</span> Your loan gets repaid in a predetermined time frame, avoiding uncertainties.</li>
        <li><span className="text-info">Accessible loans:</span> Lenders assess EMI affordability to make credit more accessible.</li>
      </ul>
      Whether itâ€™s a home loan, car loan, or personal loan, EMIs ensure that borrowing stays manageable!`,

      <code>EMI = [P Ã— R Ã— (1 + R)^N] / [(1 + R)^N - 1]</code>

        <li><span className="text-info">P -</span> Loan principal amount.</li>
        <li><span className="text-info">R -</span> Monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12).</li>
        <li><span className="text-info">N -</span> Loan tenure in months.</li>

      <ul class="m-4">
        <li><span className="text-info">Loan Amount:</span> Higher the principal, higher the EMI.</li>
        <li><span className="text-info">Interest Rate:</span> Even a slight rate increase can significantly impact long tenures.</li>
        <li><span className="text-info">Loan Tenure:</span> Longer tenure reduces EMI but increases total interest paid.</li>

      Want a lower EMI? Compare interest rates and adjust the tenure smartly for a better deal!`,

      <ul class="m-4">
        <li><span className="text-info">Lower Interest Outgo:</span> Paying off part of the principal early means less interest over time.</li>
        <li><span className="text-info">EMI Adjustment:</span> Reduce the EMI amount or shorten the loan tenure after prepayment.</li>
        <li><span className="text-info">Flexibility:</span> Many loans allow partial prepayments without penaltiesâ€”check with your lender!</li>
      </ul>
      Proactively managing prepayments can save you a significant amount over the loan's tenure.`,
