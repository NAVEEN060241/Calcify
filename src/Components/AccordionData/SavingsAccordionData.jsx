      body: `The savings calculator helps you estimate how much your savings will grow over time by considering several key factors:
      <ul class="m-4">
        <li><span className="text-info">Initial Deposit:</span> The amount you start with. It's your starting point for the calculation.</li>
        <li><span className="text-info">Monthly Contributions:</span> The money you add regularly to your savings. This can be weekly, monthly, or annually.</li>
        <li><span className="text-info">Interest Rate:</span> The percentage at which your savings grow over time. This can be annual, compounded interest.</li>
        <li><span className="text-info">Time Period:</span> The duration for which you're saving. Longer periods give your money more time to grow.</li>
      </ul>
      Here's the formula used in the savings calculator:
      <code class="bg-dark px-3 py-2 rounded-5 border border-secondary">Future Value = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) + (PMT Ã— ((1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1) / (r/n))</code> <br />
      Where:
      <ul class="m-4">
        <li><span className="text-info">P - </span> Principal (initial deposit)</li>
        <li><span className="text-info">r - </span> Annual interest rate (decimal)</li>
        <li><span className="text-info">n - </span> Number of times interest is compounded per year</li>
        <li><span className="text-info">t - </span> Number of years</li>
        <li><span className="text-info">PMT - </span> Monthly contribution (if any)</li>
      </ul>
      The formula calculates how your initial deposit and monthly contributions grow over time with compound interest. By entering your values in the calculator, you can easily visualize the potential growth of your savings!`,
